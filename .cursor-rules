# Design Rules and Dependencies

## Framework and Core Dependencies
- Use Svelte 5 as the front-end framework
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Use Vite as the build tool
- Use Svelte stores for state management
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling

## UI Components and Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Follow Tailwind's utility-first approach
- Use Tailwind's component classes for consistent styling
- Implement responsive design using Tailwind's responsive prefixes
- Use Tailwind's dark mode for theming
- Keep custom styles minimal and only when necessary

## Code Organization
- Keep components in src/lib/components
- Keep types in src/lib/types
- Keep stores in src/lib/stores
- Keep configuration in src/config
- Keep custom Tailwind styles in src/styles

## State Management
- Use Svelte stores for global state
- Keep component state local when possible
- Use props for component communication
- Use events for child-to-parent communication

## Development Guidelines
- Write TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Use strict TypeScript settings
- Follow Svelte 5 best practices
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility
- Use Tailwind's @apply directive sparingly
- Follow Tailwind's mobile-first approach
